        <p>I'm an interdisciplinary designer working on learning at the crossroads of technology, design, and art. I'm a Student living in India. 
            Over the last decade, I've had the chance to help my college validate, prototype, and design. In college, even though I started out as a Biomedical Engineering major, I've got an interest in Interactive Digital Media,  mass communication, and art. </p>
        <p>I'm working on small interactive web projects, mostly in WordPress and HTML, doing some Portraits. Once I was done with school, I was ready. 
            I always seek to learn new things.I want to learn how real technology was being designed and built. </p>
